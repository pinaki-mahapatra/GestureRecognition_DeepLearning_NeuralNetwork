# GestureRecognition_DeepLearning_NeuralNetwork

Imagine you are working as a data scientist at a home electronics company which manufactures state of the art smart televisions. You want to develop a cool feature in the smart-TV that can recognise five different gestures performed by the user which will help users control the TV without using a remote.

The gestures are continuously monitored by the webcam mounted on the TV. Each gesture corresponds to a specific command:

- Thumbs up:  Increase the volume
- Thumbs down: Decrease the volume
- Left swipe: 'Jump' backwards 10 seconds
- Right swipe: 'Jump' forward 10 seconds  
- Stop: Pause the movie
 

Each video is a sequence of 30 frames (or images). In the next couple of lectures, our subject matter expert Snehansu will walk you through the structure of the dataset.

To get started with the model building process, you first need to get the data on your storage. 

In order to get the data on the storage, perform the following steps in order

- Open the terminal
- go down https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1ehyrYBQ5rbQQe6yL4XbLWe3FMvuVUGiL
- unzip Project_data.zip
